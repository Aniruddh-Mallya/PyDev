## 1. PyHangmanGame : 

This is a simple game of Hangman, wherein one has to arrive at a word by means of guessing the correct set of letters, in a limited number of moves.
On running the code in any of the Python interpreters, we must enter the 'No of players' and 'No of computers', followed by entering one letter at a time and pressing 'Enter'. The code is available as 'PyHangmanGame.py'

## 2. Pong : 

In this project, we build a version of Pong, one of the first arcade video games (1972). While Pong is not particularly exciting compared to today's video games, it  still kind of a game that you can play and have some fun with. Pong is played on a rectangular table. We have a ball that's moving in a straight line and it bounces off the walls in a predictable manner, using basic physics. 
There are two players, and each player controls a paddle using some keys. We can't move it left and right, we can only move it up and down.
The keys for 'Player-1' to move the paddle up and down are 'W' and 'S' respectively.
Likewise, 'Player-2' moves the paddles up and down using the 'upper arrow' and 'lower arrow' respectively.

First up to execute the program, we click on 'Run' on Codeskulptor. This opens up a new UI window. To start the game, we click on 'Start new game'.
We notice, the ball's moving around on the table. It bounces on the top and bottom walls. However, if it misses the paddle & strikes the left gutter, 'Player-2' gets a point. Vice-versa, if it strikes the right gutter, 'Player-1' steals a point. The game ends when one of the player manages to score 10 points. To resume play, click on 'P'. 

Since the program make use the Python library 'simplegui' available only on CodeSkulptor, we recommend running 'Pong.py' on the official CodeSkulptor website on any browser (preferably Chrome). The link for the website is https://py2.codeskulptor.org/
