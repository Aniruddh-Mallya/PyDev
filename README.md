## 1. PyHangmanGame : 

This is a simple game of Hangman, wherein one has to arrive at a word by means of guessing the correct set of letters, in a limited number of moves.
On running the code in any of the Python interpreters, we must enter the 'No of players' and 'No of computers', followed by entering one letter at a time and pressing 'Enter'. The code is available as 'PyHangmanGame.py'

## 2. Pong : 

### Intro
In this project, we build a version of Pong, one of the first arcade video games (1972). While Pong is not particularly exciting compared to today's video games, it  still kind of a game that one can play and have some fun with. 
Pong is played on a rectangular table. We have a ball that's moving in a straight line and it bounces off the walls in a predictable manner, using basic physics. 

### Rules
There are two players, and each player controls a paddle using some keys. We can't move it left and right, we can only move it up and down. On starting the game, the ball moves around on the table. It bounces on the top and bottom walls. When it strikes either of the paddles, it bounces back as well. However, if it misses the paddle & strikes the left gutter, 'Player-2' gets a point. Vice-versa, if it strikes the right gutter, 'Player-1' steals a point. When any player loses a point, the ball stops and positions itself to the centre of the board. The game ends when one of the player manages to score 10 points.

### Keys
The keys for 'Player-1' to move the paddle up and down are 'W' and 'S' respectively.
Likewise, 'Player-2' moves the paddles up and down using the 'upper arrow' and 'lower arrow' respectively. 
To start a new game, we click on 'Start new game'.
To resume play after gaining/losing a point, click on 'P'. 

### Execution

Since the program make use the Python library 'simplegui' available only on CodeSkulptor. The recommended browser is Chrome/Safari.
